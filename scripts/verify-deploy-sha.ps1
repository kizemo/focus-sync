# ============================================================================
# verify-deploy-sha.ps1 -- ACCEPTANCE GATE for the packaging task
# ============================================================================
# Implements handoff-2026-10-08-packaging.md section 1:
#   "the acceptance criterion is NOT 'install succeeded', it is
#    'the installed files are byte-identical to the manual deployment'."
#
# This script IS that criterion, executable. Exit 0 = PASS, exit 1 = FAIL.
#
# Locations checked are exactly the ones listed in handoff section 1.
# Nothing is invented -- a location that does not exist yet is reported
# MISSING and fails the gate on purpose (that is the whole point: the
# historical failure shipped a stale payload and "installed fine").
#
# NOTE: ASCII-only on purpose. PowerShell 5.1 reads .ps1 as ANSI when there
# is no BOM, so a UTF-8 non-ASCII comment can corrupt quoting (this project
# was burned by exactly that -- see hard constraint 9).
#
# Usage:
#   powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts\verify-deploy-sha.ps1
#   powershell ... -File scripts\verify-deploy-sha.ps1 -Json
# ============================================================================
